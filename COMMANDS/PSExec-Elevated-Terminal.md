# PSExec Elevated Terminal

== Running commands as  can be risky! Youâ€™re essentially bypassing user-level restrictions ==

- The command  launches a Command Prompt interactively under the Local System account. 
- This is a powerful way to run commands with elevated privileges on the local machine.

-i (Interactive) Used for debugging, elevated permissions, or access to protected resources
-s (System-level Access) runs local system account, not current user; gives access beyond Admin privileges (non-user level restrictions)
