## TABLE FORMATTING
- You can create tables with pipes `|` and hyphens `-`.
- Hyphens are used to create each column's header, while pipes separate each column.
- You must include a blank line before your table in order for it to correctly render.
- The pipes on either end of the table are optional.
- Cells can vary in width and do not need to be perfectly aligned within columns.
- There must be at least three hyphens in each column of the header row.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Command 1 | Command 1 description |
| Command 2 | Command 2 description |

-You can align text to the left, right, or center of a column by including colons `:` to the left, right, or on both sides of the hyphens within the header row.
| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
